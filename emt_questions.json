EMTs should not approach an armed individual regardless of the circumstances. Retreat to safety and request law enforcement to secure the scene and the weapon before approaching the patient."}, {"id": "emt-043", "level": "EMT", "type": "mc", "domain": "Patient Treatment and Transport", "topic": "Seizures", "difficulty": "easy", "stem": "A patient is actively seizing. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate action?", "options": ["Restrain the patient's extremities to prevent injury", "Place a bite block between the patient's teeth", "Protect the patient from injury and suction as needed", "Hold the patient's tongue to prevent airway obstruction"], "correct": 2, "explanation": "During an active seizure, the EMT should move objects away from the patient to prevent injury, not restrain the patient. Never place objects in the mouth. After the seizure, position the patient on their side (recovery position), suction as needed, and assess for injuries."}, {"id": "emt-044", "level": "EMT", "type": "mc", "domain": "Operations", "topic": "Ambulance Operations", "difficulty": "easy", "stem": "When operating an ambulance with lights and sirens, you approach a red traffic light at an intersection. You should:", "options": ["Proceed through without stopping since you have lights and sirens", "Come to a complete stop, ensure all lanes are clear, then proceed", "Slow down and proceed with caution", "Turn off lights and sirens before entering the intersection"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Even with emergency lights and sirens activated, ambulance operators must come to a complete stop at red lights and stop signs.

Your FIRST action in establishing incident command should be:", "options": ["Begin triaging patients immediately", "Assume incident command and transmit a brief initial report", "Request additional resources before doing anything else", "Begin treating the most critically injured patient"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "The first arriving unit should assume incident command (IC) and provide a brief initial report including location, nature of incident, estimated number of patients, and apparent hazards. This establishes the command structure and initiates appropriate resource response. Triage follows after IC is established."}, {"id": "emt-046", "level": "EMT", "type": "mc", "domain": "Operations", "topic": "Triage", "difficulty": "hard", "stem": "During START triage at a mass casualty incident, you encounter a patient who is not breathing.

They required intervention to breathe, indicating they need immediate care. If they did not breathe after airway opening, they would be Black (Expectant)."}, {"id": "emt-047", "level": "EMT", "type": "mc", "domain": "Operations", "topic": "Hazmat Zones", "difficulty": "medium", "stem": "At a hazardous materials incident, patient decontamination takes place in the:", "options": ["Hot zone", "Warm zone", "Cold zone", "Treatment area"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "The warm zone (contamination reduction zone) is where decontamination takes place. The hot zone is the contaminated area where only hazmat-trained personnel in appropriate PPE may enter. The cold zone is the safe area where the command post and treatment areas are established."}, {"id": "emt-048", "level": "EMT", "type": "mc", "domain": "Operations", "topic": "Extrication", "difficulty": "medium", "stem": "Your patient is trapped in a vehicle and requires extrication.

This includes maintaining cervical spine stabilization, monitoring the patient's condition, providing reassurance, and protecting the patient from hazards (covering with a blanket, etc.). Extrication tools are typically operated by trained rescue personnel."}, {"id": "emt-049", "level": "EMT", "type": "mc", "domain": "Operations", "topic": "Landing Zone", "difficulty": "hard", "stem": "You are setting up a helicopter landing zone.

What compression-to-ventilation ratio should you use?", "options": ["30:2", "15:2", "30:1", "5:1"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "For two-rescuer CPR on a child (age 1 to puberty), the compression-to-ventilation ratio is 15:2. This differs from single-rescuer CPR (30:2) and provides more ventilations proportionally, which is important because pediatric cardiac arrest is more commonly respiratory in origin."}]
